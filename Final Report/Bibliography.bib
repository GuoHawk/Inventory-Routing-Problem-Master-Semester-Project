  abstract = {In this tutorial paper, we introduce the inventory routing problems (IRPs) with examples, we classify the characteristics of an IRP and present different models and policies for the class of problems where the crucial decision is when to serve customers. We call this class the problems with decisions over time only. The contributions are on the single link case, i.e., the problem where products are shipped from a supplier to a customer with capacitated vehicles, and on the IRPs with direct shipping. We overview the pioneering papers that appeared in the eighties, the literature on the single link and direct shipping problems, and cite the surveys and the tutorials available.},

  abstract = {The inventory-routing problem (IRP) dates back 30 years. It can be described as the combination of vehicle-routing and inventory management problems, in which a supplier has to deliver products to a number of geographically dispersed customers, subject to side constraints. It provides integrated logistics solutions by simultaneously optimizing inventory management, vehicle routing, and delivery scheduling. Some exact algorithms and several powerful metaheuristic and matheuristic approaches have been developed for this class of problems, especially in recent years. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of this literature, based on a new classification of the problem. We categorize IRPs with respect to their structural variants and the availability of information on customer demand.},
